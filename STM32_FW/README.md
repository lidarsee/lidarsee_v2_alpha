# lidarsee_v2_alpha STM32 Firmware

We used the _CooCox CoIDE_ for the STM32 development. A free version can be downloaded at: http://www.coocox.org/

We highly recommend to use the version 1.7.8 and _not_ to use the 2.xx beta or any 2.x Version since the compatibility is very poor. 

For programming and debugging we used a ST-Link-V2 in SWD-Mode.
