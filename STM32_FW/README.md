# lidarsee_v2_alpha STM32 firmware

We used the CooCox CoIDE for the STM32 development. A free version can be downloaded at: http://www.coocox.org/

We highly recommend to use the version 1.7.8 and not the 2.xx beta or any 2.x Version since the comartibilty is very poor. 

For Programming and DEbug we used a ST-Link-V2 in SWD-Mode
